# Run Code
- To run the code you need to compile the Game.java (wich is the Server) and compile the Client.java 
- Then you need to use:
    - `java Game 8000` for the Server side
    - `java Client localhost 8000` for the Client side

# Game Description
The game implemented has the following logic:
- The server chooses a number from 1 to 100
- The player has to try to guess the number by turn and whoever gets the closest by the end of the time wins the most points.
- Has the player gives hints, the server responds with "far", "close" or something like it to help guide the player.
